# JAVA
### constant pool 
	used in strings an area in heap memory where Java stores literal string values. The heap is an area of memory used for run-time operations. When a new variable is created and given a value, Java checks to see if that exact value exists in the pool.

## deep and shallow copy

| Shallow Copy                                                                                  | Deep Copy                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.                 | Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.                                               |
| Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.           | Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.      |
| Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects. | Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well. |
| A shallow copy is faster.                                                                     | Deep copy is comparatively slower.                                                           |

## Event Loop 
	 to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API, handling user events, or setting timeouts without pausing execution. This is made possible by the event loop.
