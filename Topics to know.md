## 1. golden ratio
	golden proportion or the divine proportion, is a ratio between two numbers that equals approximately 1.618

 
## interpolation 
 - using `{}` to print a variable in html

# JAVA
### constant pool 
	used in strings an area in heap memory where Java stores literal string values. The heap is an area of memory used for run-time operations. When a new variable is created and given a value, Java checks to see if that exact value exists in the pool.

# general
## deep and shallow copy

| Shallow Copy                                                                                  | Deep Copy                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.                 | Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.                                               |
| Shallow Copy reflects changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.           | Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object.      |
| Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the references to the objects. | Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well. |
| A shallow copy is faster.                                                                     | Deep copy is comparatively slower.                                                           |

### Evaluation metrics
- #### accuracy
	- It calculated by dividing models correct predictions with the total predictions 
- #### Precision
	- Measure the proportion of correctly predicted positive predictions out of all instances predicted as positive
- #### Recall
	- Measure the proportion of all the correctly predicted positive out of count of actual positive instances
- #### F1 score
	- Mean of both precision and recall
