#### Multer
	Multer simplifies file upload management in Node.js applications by offering a robust middleware solution. Without Multer, developers would have to create custom code to handle file uploads, a process that is complex and time-consuming. Multer enhances the file upload process and presents a user-friendly interface for file management.
	- Support for uploading both single and multiple files
	- Seamless integration with Express for a streamlined implementation
	- Customizable settings for file size, file type, and storage location
