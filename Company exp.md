I am Vishal M, and I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning degree at Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai. I have completed my schooling in Agaram public school,Dharapuram. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with the latest technology available and also love working across both frontend and backend development, making me a well-rounded full-stack developer.

I’ve had hands-on industry experience through internships, including my recent role as an LLM fine-tuner and Full-Stack Developer at Centillion Labs, where I built and integrated personalized chatbots powered by LLMs into company websites with the help of Vertex AI and the concept of grounding. And, I worked as a Frontend Developer at Genpixels, where I contributed to enhancing user experience by implementing dynamic and interactive website features.

In terms of technical skills, I’m familiar in Python, C, Java, javaScript and SQL. My toolkit includes frameworks, and Libraries like Flask, React, Node.js, and Streamlit, along with experience in working with databases like MongoDB and MySQL. I’ve also used tools like Git, Power BI, and GCP’s Vertex AI.

I’ve applied my skills in projects such as a full-fledged **Job Portal**, a **Skin Disease Classifier** using CNNs , and a **Commodity Price Predictor** using historical data analysis. These projects helped me gain deeper insights into React, TensorFlow, and end-to-end ML deployment.

My areas of interest lie in **web application development and LLM integration**, and I’m excited about how emerging tech like generative AI can be used to build more intelligent and responsive systems. I’ve also received recognition such as the **"Feather of the Cap" award** at Centillion Labs for the sincere commitment in work and meeting the expectation of the company over a short period of time, and conducted a **workshop on Generative AI with Cloud**, which further honed my public speaking and training skills.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been actively involved in various tech initiatives. I currently serve as the **Technical Head of the AI Association** and an **Executive Member of the AI Coding Club**. In these roles, I’ve organized hackathons, coding contests, and paper presentations, which have helped foster a collaborative learning culture while strengthening my own skills in leadership and project execution.

Looking ahead, i want to dive into the field of natural intelligence as deep as possible. since i believe in the saying of "change is the only constant thing", so i want to excel in the adaptability to learn any new that peaks interest in me or that i might be in  a position to learn. 

I'm now looking forward to roles where I can continue to innovate and grow, especially in areas like Web App Development and LLM-based solutions.

- constructor and destructor
	- a special method used to initialize an object when it's created, ensuring it starts in a valid state.
	- java doesn't have a destructor instead we override finalize function just to represent
	- in python it is `__init__` for constructor and `__del__` for destructor
	-  in c++ we use function with the name of class as constructor `job()` and tild symbol for destructor `~job()`
